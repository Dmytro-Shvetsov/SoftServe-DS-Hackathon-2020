In this repository, I publish my work on Employee Dismissal Risk problem, proposed by SoftServe in a Kaggle Competition, May 12-17.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
People turnover numbers were always important for any organization, especially in the case of their continued growth â€“ the more the organization is growing the more these numbers become critical. Therefore, it is more significant now than ever to make sure that the number of voluntary dismissals is very low. As this would lead to huge savings
related to the cost per hire, including advertising, recruiting, training, internship expenses, and variance in salary between hired
and dismissed employees. Obviously, the most cost-efficient and effective approach overall is to manage unwanted dismissals by preventing them in a timely manner before a person makes the final decision to leave the company.

We propose to participate in the competition on best solution in the area of HR Analytics and try to develop the predictive model, which provides the assessment of the Employees Dismissal Risk, based on the historical data analysis.

<h3>Problem Description</h3>
The major goal of the competition - develop a model, which provides an answer to the question - "Will the particular Employee leave the Company within the next three months?"
